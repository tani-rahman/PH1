<section class="description">
  <p>In a defining moment of our history, Bangladesh is undergoing a monumental transformation. After more than 15 years under a regime marked by corruption, oppression and exploitation, a courageous revolution led by our students has ignited a new era. The fall of this autocratic government has paved the way for an unprecedented opportunity to rebuild our beloved nation under the interim leadership of Dr. Muhammad Yunus—Nobel laureate, visionary economist, and a beacon of hope. This new chapter, "Bangladesh 2.0," represents not just a political shift, but the rekindling of our national spirit.</p>
 <p>Bangladesh stands before a transformative political phase, driven by a people's call for a drastic paradigm shift in politics. The people have collectively emerged as a new political community—one that transcends traditional notions of the nation-state. This de novo political community is not a fleeting product of the 36 days of July but rather the culmination of years of sustained political resistance. </p>
  <h3>Dr. Muhammad Yunus</h3>
  <p>Chief Adviser of the People's Republic of Bangladesh</p>

        The protests began with student demonstrations against a controversial government job quota. Gen Z college students managed to organize broad resistance to the system reserving 30% of civil service posts for the descendants of freedom fighters from the 1971 War of Independence. In the ensuing crackdown, more than 600 people died, many more were injured, and many disappeared.
        What will it take to rebuild the nation after the July Revolution? This documentary film follows the leaders of the student movement, members of the interim government and victims of the former regime.

        Climate scientists say warming temperatures and droughts are making wildfires more frequent and intense.
        The “Pyrocene” is upon us. At least, that is the theory which was first introduced by fire historian Stephen Pyne in a 2015 essay.
        United States Forest Service ecologist Gavin Jones described the Pyrocene in a 2023 interview with The Explorers Journal as the current era in which humans experience greater fire activity than before. The key driver – human activity.
